Adrija spends her time at Nyaaya explaining laws in a simple manner, writing blog posts, having heated discussions and liaising with lawyers and NGOs. She loves that all her work leads back to the question of access to law and constantly asks of herself “What does a non-lawyer need to know about the law?”. She credits this to her friends and teachers at college helping her develop a nuanced understanding of access through courses, long-winded class discussions and late night conversations in the girls hostel!
