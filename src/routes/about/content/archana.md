Archana is a dog person who loves watching tv shows and movies, and breaking down all the things she liked and disliked about it. She has always been fascinated with new technology and drifted towards working in tech no matter how many bad decisions she makes. By leading the Nyaaya initiative she hopes to steer her orientation to tech a bit more in the helpful direction than being harmful. Her favourite way to spend time is by doing absolutely nothing, preferably being surrounded by nature.
