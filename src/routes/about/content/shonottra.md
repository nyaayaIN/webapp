By day, Shonottra is a Legal Researcher for Nyaaya, and by night, she sleeps. She is a recent LLM graduate from Trinity College Dublin, who aspires to make a difference in the development sector. Hence, Nyaaya! She’s a sidekick to the superheroes (content writers) in getting the right information to you, in the simplest of terms. She believes she’s saving the world by helping simplify one law at a time. And yes, she also believes in fairies!
