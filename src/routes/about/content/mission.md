Today, information on laws is difficult to access. Legal language is complex, and there are economic and language barriers that pose special challenges. There is no single resource aimed at the average person, that explains where the law stands in a straightforward manner using an accessible, user-friendly format. Understanding the law empowers people to seek protection, stand up for their rights as well as know their duties and responsibilities.

Knowledge of the laws is a privilege, and even though laws are applicable to everyone, those who understand the law, do have an advantage. This is where Nyaaya seeks to make an impact and make legal information accessible and available to everyone.
