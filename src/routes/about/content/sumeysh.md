Sumeysh identifies himself as a social justice lawyer, and has an LLM in Human Rights from SLS, Pune. Heâ€™s the first point of contact for feedback and for collaborations. He feels that one of the hazards of his job is the constant exposure to social media, which has done irreparable damage to his attention span, and filled his head with random, obscure knowledge! If Nyaaya were a rock band, Sumeysh would be the drummer, working in the background, but making the most noise.
