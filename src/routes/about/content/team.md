The Nyaaya team is made up of people from different professional backgrounds and experiences. We are all united by our common passion of making laws more accessible to everyone. While each team member has a designated role, there is robust cross-functionality amongst the team members, with both primary and secondary duties for everyone feeding into the overall organizational vision.
