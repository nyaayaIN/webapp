          "<p>No, they do not need a warrant if they suspect that you committed a serious crime. Such crimes for which you can be arrested even without an arrest warrant are known as 'cognizable' crimes. Examples include murder, sexual offences, acid attack, rioting, starting a fire etc. Normally, it is the Magistrate which will issue a warrant to arrest you. Since these type of crimes need urgent action from the police, the police can take charge even without permission from the Magistrate.</p><p>Non-cognizable crimes are less serious crimes such as adultery, defamation etc. When a non-cognizable crime has been committed, the police needs the permission of the Magistrate to make an arrest. Generally, since these crimes are more private in nature and do not need the police to act urgently, the normal process of getting permission from the Magistrate must be followed. There is an exception to this general rule if the police see you committing or someone accuses you of committing a non-cognizable crime when the police are around. In such situations the police can arrest you if you refuse to tell them your name and address or give them the wrong name and address.</p>"

          "<p>The police can arrest you without a warrant in two broad cases. One, where you are suspected of having committed a cognizable crime. Two, where the police suspect you are planning to commit a cognizable crime.</p><p>In the first category, the law lays down the specific situations in which the police can arrest you without an arrest warrant:<ul><li>when you commit a crime in front of a police officer (for example at a public event or in a police station);</li><li>when the police have received reliable information or a complaint that you have committed a cognizable crime;</li><li>if the court has declared you as a proclaimed offender;</li><li>if the police found you with stolen property and they suspect you;</li><li>if you cause trouble to a police officer who is performing her duty;</li><li>if you escape from custody;</li><li>if you are suspected of deserting the army;</li><li>if you are a suspect in a crime outside India and you are liable to be brought back to India; or</li><li>if you were convicted of a crime in the past and have violated rules relating to released convicts.</li></ul></p><p>The possibility of being arrested is much lesser if you have been accused of a cognizable crime with jail time of less than seven years. The police should have reliable information which points to your involvement. Further you can be arrested only if:<ul><li>you are likely to escape, destroy evidence, or influence the victim or witnesses,</li><li>you are likely to commit yet another crime, or</li><li>if your presence is necessary for police investigation.</li></ul></p><p>The Supreme Court has held that in every such case the police must begin by issuing a 'notice of appearance' asking you to appear at the police station. If the police then think that they need to arrest you, they will need to have proper reasons for doing so and will need to record these reasons. The police officer makes an 'Arrest Memo' at the time of arrest that contains this and other details which is signed by you. The Supreme Court has also directed the police to issue a notice of appearance within 2 weeks of starting a case. If they are not making an arrest, they have to inform the Magistrate.</p>"

If you are a woman, then a female doctor has to conduct the investigation.</li><li>If the police think that a medical examination can prove that you committed a crime, then can ask a doctor to conduct an examination on you.

They cannot keep you under arrest for more than 24 hours – this excludes travel time to the court. The police officer will also need to provide a copy of the entries in the case diary to the Magistrate. The case diary is a daily diary kept by an officer detailing all that happens in an investigation. The Supreme Court has directed the police officers to provide the Magistrate a checklist of the reasons for your arrest along with all documents related to your arrest including the arrest memo.</p><p>After you've been presented before the Magistrate, the Magistrate can discharge you or grant you bail. Your lawyer should ask for your release if the police only needed to issue a 'notice of appearance' and not actually arrest you. The police can detain you beyond 24 hours only with permission of the Magistrate. They may seek 'police custody' or 'judicial custody'. Police custody can only last 15 days from the date of arrest. This means you will kept inside the lock-up at the police station for a maximum of fourteen more days.</p><p>If the police have not been able to file the charge-sheet and depending on the crime you have been suspected of, you can be in judicial custody for up to 90 days for crimes that you could possibly go to prison for more than 10 years, and up to 60 days for all other kinds of offences.</p><p>You cannot be sent to jail for more than fourteen days at a time even in judicial custody. You will be brought before the Magistrate after each fourteen day period. After the 60 or 90 day period, you have a right to be released on bail.</p>"
