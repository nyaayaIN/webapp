The business could belong to or be run by immediate family (mother, father, brother or sister) or extended family (father’s sister and brother, or mother’s sister and brother).</p><p>It is important that the family business does not involve dangerous substances or processes (the term in law is ‘hazardous’ occupation or process). The law tells us what jobs are considered hazardous. Mines, explosives and processes involved in the coal, power generation industries etc are included. For, the full list of hazardous occupations or processes, please read the list of industries provided here.</p><p>Even though it is lawful to use children in the family business, the child’s education must not be affected.
