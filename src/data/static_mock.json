      "While laws exist for the citizens of the country, they seem to be written for lawyers to read and  understand. Knowing the law strongly affects your ability to get results from the justice system that are in your favour. We hope that by helping someone understand the laws that affect them and navigate the legal system, we're taking a step towards improving how the system works for the people of India."
